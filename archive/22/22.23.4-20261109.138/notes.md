### Vulnerabilities

| ID | Severity | Package | Installed | Comes from | Fixed upstream in | Architectures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [CVE-2026-84243](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-84243) | High | `glibc-2.44` | 2.44-r14 | `glibc-2.44 2.44-r14` | no fix yet | x86_64, aarch64 |

*Comes from* is the Wolfi package that brings the affected code into the image; a library bundled inside npm, for example, comes from the npm package. *Fixed upstream in* is the version of the affected code that fixes it; the image gets the fix when the package it comes from ships that version, and the next build after that publishes it.
